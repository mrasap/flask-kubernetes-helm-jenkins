Demo app of a simple flask application, that I am trying to deploy in a kubernetes cluster.

I am using my powdermaps.com domain to play around, the kubernetes cluster is from DigitalOcean.


### Flask app
github repo: https://github.com/mrasap/flask

The flask app is very simple, has a sqlite database for data persistence.
There are 2 url routes:
- / 	Returns the amount of records in the sqlite database.
- /increase	Adds another record to the sqlite database and returns it.


### Kubernetes-helm setup
github repo: https://github.com/mrasap/flask-kubernetes-helm

The current application builds further upon the kubernetes-helm setup, in which I now want to add a CI pipeline through jenkins.
baseline helm chart: https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/jenkins
